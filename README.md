Overview of the Project

Project: Interfacing a DHT Sensor with Arduino for Temperature and Humidity Monitoring

Objective:
The objective of this project was to measure and display real-time temperature and humidity data using a DHT11 sensor and Arduino. The data was outputted to the Serial Monitor, providing a simple and interactive way to observe environmental changes.
Key Activities

    Sensor Integration: Connected the DHT11 sensor to the Arduino to capture temperature and humidity readings.
    Code Development: Wrote a beginner-friendly Arduino sketch to process the data and handle sensor errors.
    Data Output: Configured the Serial Monitor for real-time display of temperature and humidity values.
    Troubleshooting: Addressed sensor reading failures and ensured consistent output.

Technologies Used

    Arduino UNO: Microcontroller used for the project.
    DHT11 Sensor: For collecting temperature and humidity data.
    DHT Library: To interface the sensor with Arduino code.
    Arduino IDE: For programming and uploading the code.
